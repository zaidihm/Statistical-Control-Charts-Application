# 📊 Application of Linear Algebra in Control Charts for Process Monitoring  

### 📌 Project Overview  
This study explores the integration of **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** with **statistical control charts** (Shewhart, EWMA) to enhance **process monitoring** in multivariate datasets. Using the **wine quality dataset**, the research highlights improvements in **anomaly detection, process sensitivity, and dimensionality reduction**, retaining **over 95% of data variance** while enhancing detection capabilities.  

### 🔥 Features  
- **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction**  
- **Shewhart & EWMA control charts for anomaly detection**  
- **Analysis of multivariate wine quality dataset**  
- **Comparison of different statistical process monitoring techniques**  

### 📊 Dataset Information  
- **Dataset:** Wine Quality Dataset (Kaggle)  
- **Samples:** 6,497 total (Red: 1,599, White: 4,898)  
- **Features:** 11 physicochemical properties (e.g., acidity, alcohol, residual sugar)  
- **Target Variable:** Wine Quality Score (0-10 scale)  

### 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **NumPy & Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn**  

### 📊 Key Findings  
- **SVD reduced dataset dimensionality from 11 features to 2 while retaining 95% variance**  
- **Shewhart Charts effectively flagged significant deviations**  
- **EWMA Charts detected gradual process shifts**  
- **Combining SVD with control charts improved sensitivity & reduced dimensional noise**
